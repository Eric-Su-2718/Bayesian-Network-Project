# STA531 Final Project
This repo contains my code and reports for the final project on quantifying performance levels of professional tennis players using a Bayesian network model in R. The final report is in the file "STA531_Final_Project.pdf". (or click [here](https://github.com/Eric-Su-2718/Bayesian-Network-Project/blob/master/STA531_Final_Project.pdf)) To view the code for my analysis, please read "STA531 Final Project.Rmd".

Methods used:
* Bayesian network
* Probit regression (used to construct the Bayesian network)
* Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
